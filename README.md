# 📦 PlotChain – Blockchain-Based Land Record Management System

PlotChain is a decentralized land record management system built using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in property transactions. By leveraging smart contracts, PlotChain makes land ownership records immutable and verifiable, reducing fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies in the real estate ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Immutable Land Records**  
  All property records are stored on-chain, ensuring tamper-proof documentation.

- 🧾 **Smart Contract Automation**  
  Automates key processes such as ownership transfer, document validation, and history tracking.

- 👨‍💼 **Multi-User Roles**  
  - **Landowner:** Register and verify land  
  - **Government Official:** Approve or reject land submissions  
  - **Buyer:** View land and initiate ownership transfer

- 🌍 **3D Land Visualization (Planned)**  
  View geospatial land data in an intuitive 3D format for better understanding.

- 💸 **Transparent Transactions**  
  Every ownership change is traceable and publicly verifiable via blockchain.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Blockchain:** Polygon (Mumbai Testnet) / Ethereum  
- **Web3 Integration:** Ethers.js  
- **Tools:** Hardhat, IPFS (for file storage), MetaMask

## 📑 Smart Contracts

- `LandRegistry.sol` – Core logic for land registration, transfer, and validation  
- `UserRoles.sol` – Manages roles like buyer, seller, and government official  
- `Verifier.sol` – Handles record approval and validator logic

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User connects wallet**
2. **Registers land with metadata and document hash**
3. **Government verifies and approves**
4. **Buyer can view and purchase land**
5. **Smart contract updates ownership on-chain**
